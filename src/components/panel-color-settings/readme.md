# Panel Color Settings

Identical to the `PanelColorSettings` Component in `@wordpress/editor`, except that it **renders children even if there are no color pickers available**.

Why do we need this component? We need this for now until issue https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/12583 is addressed in Gutenberg.
