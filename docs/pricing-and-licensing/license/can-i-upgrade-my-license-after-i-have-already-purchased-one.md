# Can I Upgrade My Current License After Purchasing One?

Yes, you can upgrade or downgrade your current license to anytime.

When upgrading, the expiration of your annual license would renew from the current date of purchase, and the purchase price would be a prorated price, and will be computed based on the number of unused days in your current plan.
