# Where Can I Find My License Key?

### 1. **Through the “Thank You” Email**

The first place to look for Stackable if in the “Thanks for Upgrading” email we sent you when you first became our customer. There should be a download link for the plugin as well as your license key inside the email.

### **2. By Logging Into Your Stackable Account**

Once logged in, navigate to the **Licenses** area on the side menu and you should be able to find your license key from there.
