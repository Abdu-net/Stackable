# Where Do I Download Stackable Premium? \(TODO\)

### **Through the “Thank You” Email**

The first place to look for Stackable if in the “Thanks for Upgrading” email we sent you when you first became our customer ❤️There should be a download link for the plugin inside the email.

### **Through your WordPress Site Admin**

*  If you have the free version of Stackable installed and activated, on your WordPress dashboard, navigate to _**Stackable &gt; Account**_.
* Enter in your license key if you haven’t yet, and you should be able to see your account details.
* Click the _**Download Professional Version**_ button to download the Premium plugin
