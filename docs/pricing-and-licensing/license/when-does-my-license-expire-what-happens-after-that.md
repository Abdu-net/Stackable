# When Does my License Expire? What Happens After That?

Your license key expires one year after your purchase or last upgrade.

When your license key expires, you will no longer receive Stackable Premium plugin updates.

Stackable Premium however, will still continue to work in your site. The premium features that you have will still be available for you to use and the blocks you are using will still function the same.

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that since you will no longer have plugin updates, you will no longer bug fix updates, WordPress new version compatibility updates and new feature updates.
{% endhint %}

Aside from this, you will no longer receive technical customer support.

You can always renew your license with us to get updates and support again.
