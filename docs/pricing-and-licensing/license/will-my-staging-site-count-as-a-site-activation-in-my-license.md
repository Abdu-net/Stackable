# Will My Staging Site Count as a Site Activation in My License?

Nope, your staging site, local development site, or tests site wonâ€™t be counted as a site in your license.

If you are under a single site license, it should be fine to use your license key in another another site for staging/testing/development purposes as long as the domain matches these:

Here are the Top-level domains that are considered as dev or staging:

* \*.dev
* \*.dev.cc \(DesktopServer\)
* \*.test
* \*.local
* \*.staging
* \*.example
* \*.invalid
* \*.myftpupload.com \(GoDaddy\)
* \*.cloudwaysapps.com \(Cloudways\)
* \*.wpsandbox.pro \(WPSandbox\)
* \*.ngrok.io \(tunneling\)

And here are the Subdomains that are considered as dev or staging:

* local.\*
* dev.\*
* test.\*
* stage.\*
* staging.\*
* stagingN.\* \(SiteGround; N is an unsigned int\)
* \*.wpengine.com \(WP Engine\)
* dev-\*.pantheonsite.io \(Pantheon\)
* test-\*.pantheonsite.io \(Pantheon\)
* staging-\*.kinsta.com \(Kinsta\)
* staging-\*.kinsta.cloud \(Kinsta\)
* \*.mystagingwebsite.com \(Pressable\)

And for localhost:

* localhost:\* \(any port\)
