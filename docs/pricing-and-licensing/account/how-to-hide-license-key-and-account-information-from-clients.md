# How to Hide License Key and Account Information From Clients

If you're using Stackable Premium on a client site and you want to hide your license and account details, here's how to do it.

Log in first into your Stackable Account.

{% page-ref page="where-do-i-log-into-my-stackable-account.md" %}

Navigate to **Websites**, then click on the website entry you want to hide the information on. Then on the right pane that opens, tick the checkbox that says **This license is activated on my client\(s\) site\(s\)**

Once checked, your license key and other info will be hidden from the admin.
