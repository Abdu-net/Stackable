# What Happens if I Find Out it Doesn't Work with the Theme or Plugin on my Site?

Stackable should work across any theme. But if you encounter some issues with your theme or another plugin, you can check first our list of common issues first for a possible solution.

{% page-ref page="../../troubleshooting/common-issues/" %}

If you can't find the resolution for the issue there, you can contact our support team and let us know and we will fix the conflicting issue.

{% page-ref page="../../troubleshooting/common-issues/how-do-i-contact-support.md" %}

Alternatively, you can join the Stackable Community and discuss there. There's a chance that someone else in the community might have encountered the same issue too.
