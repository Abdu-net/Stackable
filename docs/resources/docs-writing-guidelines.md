# Docs Writing Guidelines

This article describes the standards when writing documentation articles for Stackable. We need writing guidelines so that we can present instructions and ideas clearly and in a consistent way to our readers.

Our documentation articles should follow these guidelines:

1. **Use H2 \(Heading 2\) for titles of major sections.** Using H2 automatically creates a table of contents on the right sidebar.
2. **Use H3 \(Heading 3\) for sub sections under H2 titles.** H3 titles should only exist under H2 titles.
3. **Use bold when pointing out words that people see on their screens.** Don't use italics or underlines.
4. **Use quotation marks for instructions for entering text.**
5. **Use the format: Stackable &gt; Settings \(in bold\) when specifying admin submenu items.**
6. **Show screenshots when specifying areas on the screen that the user will need to interact with.**
7. **Use evergreen wording or images.** As much as possible, don't use things can easily become outdated

### **✅ Good Examples**

* Navigate to **Stackable &gt; Settings**
* Click on the **Activate link**
* Enter "this string" in the text field

### ❌ Don't Do These

* Navigate to **Pages** -&gt; _Add New_
* Click on the _Activate link_
* Enter **this string** in the text field
