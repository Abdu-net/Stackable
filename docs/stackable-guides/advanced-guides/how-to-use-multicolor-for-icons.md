# How to Use Multicolor for Icons

Stackable allows you adjust the color of multiple paths or shapes in your SVG icons.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is only available in Stackable Premium
{% endhint %}

Multicolor is only available for 1\) custom uploaded icons that have multiple path elements, or 2\) for Font Awesome Pro Duotones.

#### For Custom SVG Icons

If you uploaded a custom SVG icon, Stackable tries to detect the different SVG elements that it can apply multiple colors to. These elements are SVG child tags such as `<path>`, `<shape>`, `<rectangle>`, `<circle>`, etc.

{% hint style="danger" %}
The detection isn't perfect and it can show you the wrong number of color pickers if your SVG contains multiple nested shapes and groups or `<g>` tags. 
{% endhint %}

#### For Font Awesome Pro Duotones

If you're using Font Awesome Pro, when you have a [duotone icon](https://blog.fontawesome.com/introducing-duotone/) selected, you can use multicolor to colorize the different parts of your duotone icon.
