# I Purchased Premium but I Can't See the Premium Features

If you already purchased Stackable Premium and still cannot see our Premium features, you may still have **Stackable Free plugin** installed in your website. In order to get access to the Premium features, you will need to have the **Stackable Premium plugin** installed and activated.

After you have Stackable Premium installed, you will need to activate it with the **License Key** that we have provided for you upon your purchase. Here are some links that may help you out.

When your license key is in place, you should be able to now see the Premium features of Stackable Premium.
