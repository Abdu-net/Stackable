# I Can't See the Blocks

If you have Stackable installed and activated and you can't see the blocks, there's a chance that you are editing your page using the [Classic Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/).

Stackable blocks can only be used in the Block Editor / Gutenberg, you will have to edit your pages using the Block Editor in order to see our blocks.

If you're using the [Class Editor plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/) activated, you can enable switching between the Classic Editor and the Block Editor by going into **Settings &gt; Writing**, then make sure you have the option **Allow users to switch editors** in **Yes**

When you have this option to Yes, you can click the **Switch to the Block Editor** link when editing in the Classic Editor.

To go back to the Classic Editor, you can click on the **More Tools & Options** button on the upper right corner of the screen \(the one that has 3 dots\) then click on the **Switch to Classic Editor** option.
