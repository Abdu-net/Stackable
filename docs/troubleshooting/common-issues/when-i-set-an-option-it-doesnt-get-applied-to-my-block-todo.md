# When I Set an Option, It Doesn't Get Applied to My Block

When you adjust a block's option from the inspector, your change should get reflected right away in the Block Editor, it should also apply to the frontend when viewing your page.

If you encounter some block options which aren't being applied to your block, this might mean that the theme you're using is forcing some CSS styles to be always applied to the block. When this happens, you can either contact your theme author about it, or contact us and show us the page with the issue. Most of the time, these types of issues are easy to resolve.
