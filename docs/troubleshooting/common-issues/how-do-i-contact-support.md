# How Do I Contact Support?

For pre-sales questions, bug reports and for Stackable Premium customers who need technical support, please send us an email at [support@wpstackable.com](mailto:support@wpstackable.com). 

{% hint style="info" %}
Technical support is only available for Stackable Premium customers, so if you aren't one yet, please consider upgrading to Premium.
{% endhint %}

Alternatively, inside your site's dashboard, you can navigate to **Stackable &gt; Contact Us** and send your inquiry from there.

{% hint style="info" %}
The benefit of contacting us through your site's dashboard is you can easily send us login details to your website for special technical support cases.
{% endhint %}

We also have a [Stackable Facebook Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/wpstackable), where you can discuss with other Stackable users.
