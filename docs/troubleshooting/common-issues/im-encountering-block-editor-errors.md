# I'm Encountering Block Editor Errors \(TODO Jami\)



Why WordPress blocks error out and how to fix them.

* error because block doesnt exist. Plugin deleted
* Error because block structure changed / modified
* Dynamic block error due to js rendering error
* Cant get attrs via save
* No deprecations that match
* Fix: reverse manual adjustments
* Fix: attempt block recovery
* Fix: don’t touch block and ask for plugin dev support
* Fix: don’t touch block. It will look fine in frontend
