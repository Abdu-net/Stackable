# I Cant Purchase Stackable Premium/How to Purchase Stackable Premium?

You can buy through this link: [https://wpstackable.com/premium/\#pricing-table](https://wpstackable.com/premium/#pricing-table)

If you can't see the payment prompt, you could try to buy in incognito mode/private window browser and see if it works, there might be ad blockers or extensions that might be interfering.

Alternatively, you can try buying Stackable through your WordPress dashboard. Just go to **Stackable &gt; Upgrade.**
