# I Got the Error "Your site doesn't include support for this block"

If you have Stackable installed and activated and you are encountering an error in your Block Editor that say: "Your site doesn't include support for "ugb/X" block", then please try the following solutions: 

* Do a hard refresh on your browser by holding the **shift key** while reloading the page \(SHIFT + F5 for Windows or SHIFT + CMD + R for Macs\), or
* Try clearing the cached files from your browser​ privacy settings

This usually is a browser caching issue, and doing the above should force your browser to load the latest Stackable plugin files.  
​  
If the above fixes do not work, please contact our support team and we'll see what we can do to help.
